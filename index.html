                        <b>Live Video Experience (LiVE)</b> is a semi-interactive up-front training broadcasting setup,<br/>
                        developed by <i>Dr. Ralf S. Engelschall</i>, and providing the following unique features:

                            <b>Full-HD Video-Streaming</b>:
                            LiVE combines the trainer camera and the training content into
                            a single high-quality video-stream with a resolution of 1080p (1920x1080px)
                            and 30 frames-per-second (fps). This noticably improves the overall
                            training experience in contrast to standard video conferencing
                            solutions like ZOOM, Skype or Microsoft Teams.

                            <b>Unique Up-Front Training Features</b></a>:
                            The trainer can mix his camera and the output of multiple input devices,
                            and use a Head-Up-Display (HUD) to enrich the resulting video-stream. The HUD
                            itself provides remote controllable display widgets: agenda, progress bar, training title,
                            attendee counter, company logo, banners, break timers and visual closures. In addition, the HUD provides
                            remote controllable and input receiving widgets: text/audio based popups, boolean/numeric/textual
                            votings, ad-hoc emoticons and continuous feeling statistics.

                            <b>Self-Hostable, Secure, Open Source</b>:
                            LiVE consists of Open Source Software (OSS) components, both
                            on the sender, central relay service and receiver side.
                            The trainings are protected by access codes and all network communication happens
                            transport encrypted. As a result, LiVE can be fully self-hosted on premise,
                            or running in a private or public Cloud.
